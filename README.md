# Fashion-Recommendation-System


Overview

This project develops a recommender system for RentTheRunway that suggests clothes to female customers based on their rental purposes, such as vacation, meetings, weddings, dates, and more. The recommendation is powered by a combination of customer attributes (height, weight, bust size, body type, age) and the rental reason.

The system applies collaborative filtering to group users by predicted body type and renting purpose, recommending clothes based on ratings from similar users. The goal is to enhance the customer shopping experience while preserving the latest fashion trends.
